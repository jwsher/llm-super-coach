* Morning Routine

I woke up groggy and hungover this morning.  I went out and got drunk
with my co-workers last night.  It was fun, but I drank too much and
may have overshared.

* Work

At the meeting at work today, I felt frustrated that my ideas weren't
being heard.  My co-worker Bob is obnoxious and sometimes interrupts
me when I'm trying to talk in meetings.

* After Work

I went to the gym.  I worked out hard.  It felt good. I saw Ben there
and we chatted about dating and life.

* Home

I went home and read reddit for a while and caught up on the latest
news on AI.  One day I'll start my own AI business.
